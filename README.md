# Freemius Custom CSS

This is just a small repo that holds out custom CSS for the Freemius SDK integration with our plugins.

#### pricing.css

```

## Note

If you use Freemius and want to make use of this CSS you do so at your own risk. As per the developer of the Freemius SDK, the markup for the page can change at any time and the customizations within this CSS file may be rendered useless or in a worst case scenario prevent users from seeing and using the pricing page correctly.
